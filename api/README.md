# AcquaChain IoT Sensor API Gateway

The AcquaChain IoT Sensor API Gateway is a bridge that facilitates seamless communication between AcquaChain simulated water consumption sensors and the blockchain. It ensures data integrity, secure transmission, and accurate representation of water consumption data on the AcquaDashboard blockchain.

## Overview

The primary function of the API Gateway is to provide an interface for the Acqua IoT sensors to send real-time water consumption data. Once this data is received, the API processes, validates, and then pushes the data to the AcquaDashboard smart contract on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Data Validation**: Ensures that the data sent by the IoT sensors is consistent and free of anomalies.
- **Secure Transmission**: Incorporates security measures to protect data during transmission.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Facilitates direct data transmission to the AcquaDashboard smart contract.
