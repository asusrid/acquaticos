# AcquaChain IoT Water Consumption Sensors

This repository simulates the AcquaChain IoT water consumption sensors, designed to measure water consumption by companies in real-time and send this data directly to the blockchain for transparency, efficiency, and rewards.

## Overview

The AcquaChain IoT sensors are pivotal in the Acqua ecosystem. By providing accurate, real-time water consumption data, they allow companies to monitor their usage, earn rewards through the AcquaCoin ERC20 token for water conservation, and maintain a transparent record on the AcquaDashboard blockchain.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Simulated sensors can generate water consumption data in real-time.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Sensors are integrated to push the data directly to the AcquaDashboard smart contract on the blockchain.
- **Tamper-Proof**: The design ensures that once data is sent to the blockchain, it cannot be altered, ensuring integrity and transparency.
