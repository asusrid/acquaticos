        <h2>Develop a simplified IoT-based solution to measure water usage,
             upload data to the blockchain, and tokenize water savings as
              "Acqua Credits" that can be viewed and accessed by companies.</h2>
        <p>
        In an era marked by increasing water scarcity and environmental challenges,
         businesses lack the tools and incentives to effectively monitor, manage, and reduce their water consumption in real-time. 
         Traditional methods of tracking water usage are often manual, time-consuming, and lack transparency. Furthermore, there is no standardized, decentralized system to reward businesses for their conservation efforts, nor is there a mechanism for companies to offset periods of excess usage. This gap exacerbates water wastage and hinders proactive, sustainable water management at an organizational level. AcquaChain aims to address this by offering an integrated solution combining IoT-driven monitoring with blockchain-based token rewards,
         paving the way for responsible and incentivized water usage.
